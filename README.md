# Pomodoro-Notifier-CLI for Windows 10
## Python 3.10.5

Preparation:
After cloning this repository, install all dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. I reccomend doing it on a Virtual Environment (Venv)

Usage:
This is a very simple app. The command to run it is:
`python pomotimer.py`
or 
`python pomotimer.py -w N -r N`, considering:
- -w is work time
- -r is rest time
- Long rests are always 3 times the rest time.
